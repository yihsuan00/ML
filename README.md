#### HW1 MLfoundation

##### problem 6
- dataloader to load the data and preprocess the data
- PLA function
    - using PLA algorithm to calculate the best w
    - return the `times`(for problem 6) and `w`(for problem 8) 
- run the 1126 times and plot the histrogram
##### problem 7
- dataloader to load both the training data and testing data
- PocketPLA
    - using the pocket algorithm to find the bestline over lots of line
    - return the `wp`(bestline) and `error`
    - `wp` for the testing data to evaluate the training result
    - `error` will help me more easier to track my function 
- run the 1126 times(limited in 100 updates) and plot the histrogram
##### problem 8
- dataloader to load both the training data and testing data
- PLA function
    - using PLA algorithm to calculate the best w in finite updates
    - return the `times` and `w`
- run the 1126 times(limited in 100 updates) and plot the histrogram

##### operate function
- using jupyter to run the code is better
- using python will need to annotate part of the code or the picture will not show properly
